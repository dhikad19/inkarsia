        The name Inkarsa combines three ideas in one word. <b>“Ink”</b>{" "}
        represents writing, expression, and the creative marks that shape every
        design.
        <b>“Inspiration”</b> conveys the spark where every idea begins. “Karsa,”
        an Indonesian word, reflects will, intent, and creativity—the drive to
        bring those ideas to life. Together, they capture the essence of
        Inkarsa: turning inspiration into purposeful, lasting design.

      From Inspiration to Creation Inkarsa was created from the belief that
      every idea holds the potential to become a meaningful digital experience.
      The name comes from a blend of inspiration and karsa—an Indonesian word
      that represents will, intent, and creativity. Together, they reflect the
      essence of Inkarsa: transforming inspiration into purposeful design.
      Identity The Inkarsa logo represents more than a visual mark. Three
      vertical bars symbolize process, structure, and the foundation of design.
      The red circle highlights innovation and attention to detail—the small
      touches that elevate user experiences. The composition as a whole balances
      simplicity with function, echoing the harmony between UI and UX. This
      philosophy serves as the foundation: creating design that is both
      beautiful and functional. Vision Empowering designers and creators to turn
      ideas into intuitive and impactful digital experiences. Mission Provide
      UI/UX tools that are simple, practical, and accessible. Inspire through
      curated design resources and insights. Build a space where creators can
      explore, learn, and grow. Why Inkarsa? Great design goes beyond how it
      looks—it’s about how it feels. Inkarsa was built with the belief that
      every spark of inspiration can grow into a digital experience that
      resonates.
